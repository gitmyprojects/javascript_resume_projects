<!--
    What is my greatest strength:
    Obession. The reason that this characteristic is my best despite it being more commonly used as a pajoritive
    is because it is obession that eliminates what ive seen in my experience in offices. Ive seen what every office seems to have
    at least one of and that is the person who is comfortable with saying, 'good enough' or 'thats not my job'. 
    Im greatful for finding programming because even if ive written the most perfect code, it can always be made better, 
    more efficient, used in different way, etc. Programming can feed this my obsession. That being said, being aware of this has 
    also caused me to develop a sort of built in check and balance. A compliment to a characteristic that is usually a negative. 
    That compliment being acceptance. I had to learn and develop my ability to accept circumstances, results, accomplishment etc.
    This personal formula that i've put together makes me feel that optimized to get the results i want. Those results being 
    constant growth, improvement, and adaptability. I also feel that this formula sets me aside from most others because my experience
    has been that most peoples scale is tipped too far in one direction or the other; either obsession or acceptance. I believe that
    a perfect balance of the two is not only rare but requires a self awareness to maintain that i havent seen in very many people
    and that gives me confidence that I'm a valuable asset to anything im involved in.
